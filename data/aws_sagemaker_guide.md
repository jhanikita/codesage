- SageMaker is a fully managed service to build, train, and deploy ML models.
- Key components:
  - Notebook Instances: Jupyter notebooks with pre-installed libraries.
  - Training Jobs: Train models at scale on managed compute.
  - Endpoints: Deploy models for real-time inference.
  - Feature Store: Store and retrieve features for ML models.
- Sample workflow:
